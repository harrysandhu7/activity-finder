# Welcome to the Qantas technical test for Frontend!

## Purpose

This is a technical task which will evaluate your code style, git familiarity and component approach in Angular. Use whatever approach you find appropriate.

## Description

This is a simple Angular 8 application which will get a random activity item from [BoredAPI](https://www.boredapi.com/) and allow you to filter various items on it. 

## Task

1. Push this repository into your own github
2. Create a feature branch to allow the following:
- Allow the user to set a price range and type of activity, and show the first 5 results on the main page as a series of cards
- When a user clicks on a card, a modal should pop up showing the details of the activity
- Note, rough suggested wireframes are available at https://www.figma.com/file/a1W69MrZfHKNuw84uSPt3S/Qantas-FE-Exercise?node-id=0%3A1
3. Tests are not necessary, but failing tests have been provided and fixing these will be considered favourably
4. Create a pull request to your own repository's master branch from this branch. Note that this commit has deliberately-introduced issues, and you will need to fix these to get the branch working.
5. Send link for the pull request to sara.ennaim@qantas.com.au and jessica.maurel@qantas.com.au

This exercise should take you a maximum of 2 hours.

## To start

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
